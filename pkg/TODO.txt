In RLink:
==========

* Expose directory methods in Mesquite to R (for example, list all
  algorithms (i.e., classes) that will operate on a tree and a
  character, ideally with a short description).

* Expose directory methods for inquiring about installed packages.

In Mesquite:
============

* Register location of headless Mesquite in preferences directory.

In R:
=====

* Try to obtain Mesquite location in a more automated fashion.
** More or less done. Refinement pending to Mesquite writing its home
   into a file that can distinguish between headless and awt.

* Ancestral state reconstruction.
** Should be done, but needs testing.

* Method to convert state matrix from Java to R



To build, cd into workspace directory.  Then:  sudo R CMD INSTALL RMesquite
